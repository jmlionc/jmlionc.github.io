## Professional Profile

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Final-year Statistics student with a focus on sampling, spatio-temporal data analysis, and econometrics. I am passionate about applying statistics as a tool to address complex problems in interdisciplinary contexts, particularly in economic, biological, and social domains. I stand out for my analytical skills, commitment, and intellectual curiosity—qualities that allow me to combine methodological rigor with an applied perspective, building bridges between statistics and other disciplines, and generating reliable evidence to support strategic decisions grounded in data and context.
